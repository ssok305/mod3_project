 ## Introduction
 This website's intended use is to allow the user to create an account and be able to access the Spotify API. Once they are able to login into the website they are able to look at popular songs from different playlists Spotify generates.

## Unsolved Problems:
As I was a bit ambitious I couldn't fully grasp the authentication from Spotify from what I wanted to create. With the problem listed as:

- Using Spotify Web playback SDK
   - Major problem was trying to configure my backend to generate tokens as for some reason I kept getting security problems. I was unable to add the feature in time
   - Wanted to add the user to save their song onto my database and allow them to listen to it on their profile. 
- Wanted the user to create posts and share their music with other users.
  - By being able to like and comment on their post and also share it.
- Also wanted to create an admin feature to help monitor posts and ensure a healthy community.

## Future Enhancements:
I plan on implementing the unsolved problems onto my project within due time as that is what started my inspiration in the first place.
